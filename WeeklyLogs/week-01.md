# Week 01 â€“ Getting Comfortable with Git & GitHub ðŸ’»âœ¨

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals for This Week
- Understand how Git works behind the scenes
- Learn how to use GitHub like a pro
- Set up my profile and make it reflect *me*
- Create my learning-log repo and organize it nicely
- Learn how to write in Markdown for logs and docs

## ðŸš§ What I'm Doing This Week
- Watching beginner-friendly Git tutorials (freeCodeCamp + Harry bhai ðŸ˜„)
- Playing with basic Git commands like `init`, `add`, `commit`, and `push`
- Exploring GitHub features like repos, branches, PRs, issues, and stars
- Made a cool profile README (finally!)
- Created this learning log and started documenting

## ðŸ§  Notes & Thoughts
- Git finally makes more sense â€” itâ€™s like saving versions of my own story
- GitHub feels more friendly now, not just for advanced devs
- Writing my logs actually feels nice (and keeps me accountable!)
- Still getting used to branches, but Iâ€™ll figure it out
