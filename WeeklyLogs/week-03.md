> ✨ *"First you learn the rules, then you learn how to break them wisely."*

## 🎯 Goals for This Week
- Start the Udemy course: **Java Certificate Prep: OCA & OCP**
- Set up my **java-quest repo** to track all notes & code
- This course will cover following topics:
  - Building Blocks of Java program [OCA]
  - Operators [OCA]
  - Flow Control [OCA]
  - Strings [OCA]
  - Arrays [OCA]
  - Date and Tim [OCA]
  - Methods [OCA]
  - Class Design [OCA]
  - Abstract Classes & Interfaces [OCA]
  - Lambdas & Functional Programming [OCA]
  - Collections [OCA]
  - Exceptions [OCA]
  - Math APIs [OCP]
  - Beyond Classes [OCP]
  - Streams [OCP]
  - Localization [OCP]
  - Modules [OCP]
  - Concurrency [OCP]
  - I/O [OCP]
  - JDBC [OCP]
- Experiment with small Java programs to lock in the basics

## 🚀 What I'm Doing
- Watching Luka Popov’s lectures & downloading PDF slides
- Writing notes in Markdown (topic-wise)
- Coding tiny demos: `HelloWorld.java`, `OperatorsDemo.java`, etc.
- Reading about `.equals()` vs `==` and other classic pitfalls

## 💡 Notes & Thoughts
- Java is verbose, but that also keeps code explicit & clear
- Flow control feels natural once you write real examples
- Remember: Strings are immutable! Every change makes a new object
- Learning for a certification is fun when you treat it like an adventure
