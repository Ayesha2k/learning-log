## 🎯 Goals for This Week
- Kick off my journey into **DSA**
- Set up a separate **DSA repo** to organize notes & code
- Refresh understanding of mathematical logic, patterns, arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues
- Start solving easy problems to get comfortable
- Track progress

## 🚧 What I'm Doing This Week
- Watching beginner-friendly DSA playlists (e.g., Take U Forward)
- Writing concise notes in Markdown about each topic
- Implementing basic data structures from scratch in my DSA repo

> 🧠 *"It's not about how many problems you solve, but how deeply you understand them."*


## 💡 Notes & Thoughts
- Writing my own implementations made concepts click better than just reading
- Even small optimizations matter once you see time complexity in action
- Taking breaks helps more than pushing non-stop
- It feels amazing to see steady progress, even if slow!
