# ðŸ§  Git Basics

This file contains notes and practice commands from my Git Basics learning.

## 1. ðŸ“š freeCodeCamp â€“ Git for Beginners

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Goals
- Understand how Git works (repository, staging, commits)
- Learn essential Git commands with practical use
- Build confidence using Git via command line
- Be able to version control personal projects or collaborate with teams

---

## ðŸª„ Core Concepts 
- Git is a distributed version control system â€” changes are **tracked locally first**
- Repositories have 3 areas: **Working directory**, **Staging area**, and **.git repo**
- Git tracks **snapshots**, not file differences (diffs)
- Every commit has a unique hash (ID)

## ðŸ§ª Common Git Commands & Their Use

| Command | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `git init` | Initialize a new local Git repository |
| `git status` | Check file status (untracked, staged, etc.) |
| `git add <file>` | Move changes to staging area |
| `git commit -m "msg"` | Save staged changes to repo |
| `git log` | View commit history |
| `git clone <url>` | Copy a remote repository |
| `git push` | Upload local commits to remote (like GitHub) |
| `git pull` | Fetch + merge changes from remote |
| `git branch` | View current branches |
| `git checkout -b new-branch` | Create + switch to a new branch |

## ðŸ§© Reflection

- Always run `git status` before committing â€” itâ€™s your friend ðŸŸ¢
- Use meaningful commit messages: *"Fix broken login", not "changed stuff"*
- Donâ€™t push sensitive files (add them to `.gitignore`)
- One commit = one logical change (donâ€™t mix unrelated changes)
